This is a description of the purpose of the html formatter python script

You can use the script to turn a html file into an c++ header file 
with a compatible multiline string containing the html saved to a macro(?) named "webpage".
This allows easier editing.

The python script also checks if the html file contains certain placeholder substrings that the MyWebserver lib needs.
